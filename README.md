# smart-fault-detection-python
Python-based digital circuit fault detection and fault coverage visualization tool.

# Smart Fault Detection in Digital Circuits (Python)

# Description
This project implements a Python-based fault detection system for combinational digital circuits.
It detects stuck-at-0 and stuck-at-1 faults using automatically generated test vectors and
visualizes fault coverage using bar graphs.

# Features
- Digital circuit simulation
- Stuck-at fault modeling (SA0 / SA1)
- Automatic test vector generation
- Fault detection reporting
- Fault coverage visualization using matplotlib

# Technologies Used
- Python
- itertools
- matplotlib

 # VLSI Concepts
- Combinational logic
- Design for Testability (DFT)
- Stuck-at fault model
- Fault coverage analysis
